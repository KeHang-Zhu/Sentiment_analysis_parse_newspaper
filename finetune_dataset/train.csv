". Preventing Fatalities.
Education of the motorist 'and

>y Traffic Director KldrUlge to be the
chief means of coni bating the traffic
fatalities and dangerous conditions of
the highways, in a short address at
the monthly meeting of the Washing
ton Chamber of Commerce last night.
Indicating that he intends to take
a firm stand against the drnnken
driver and the reckless speed maniac,
Mr. Eldridge declared that there were
, three phases In the campaign for
saner streets, “Education, regulation
and enforcement.”
Rules and Code Stressed.
“The first thing we must do is en
deavor to educate the people to the
rules and the code as well as their
responsibilities; we must then regu
late the traffic, and if we cannot do
this by education, then we must use
enforcement.” he said.",1
"He heartily praised the newspapers
for their efforts to support him and
, snake better traffic conditions. He
said that he would leave town tomor
row for a while.
Address by Alvin E. Dodd.
Following Mr. Eldfidge's address
Alvin E. Dodd, chief of the depart
ment of distribution of the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States,
addressed the local chamber on the
phases of distribution.
Mr. Dodd dispelled the idea that
there was a large amount of graft
between the time the product left
the hands of the producer until it
reached the consumer. He said that
a study of the subject proved that
every person who handled the prod
uce did not make such a great",0
"One of the many things that enter
into the cost of things is the cost of
failure, he said, which the public ulti
mately paid. The life of the average
grocery store is five years, he said,
and failures cost the United States
$400,000,000 per year. Mr. Dodd urged
that business men enter into an
organized effort in order to better
study the problems of distribution.
Announcement was made that the
Alexandria Chamber of Commerce
would be the guest of the local cham
ber at its May meeting. Entertain
ment was provided by Arthur Pierce,
monologist. Th usual buffet supper
was served. James T. Lloyd, presi

"Government and

preJudice bird that syrrfbolizes fair play and anew dea l for
all American citizens of all colors and creeds. At
least that is what the colored people of America have a
right to expect the Blue Eagle to symbolize.
Despite the many glaring slights, injustices, and
hardships our people are experiencing, in connection with
the adjusting of wages and working hours under certain
industrial codes, we are hopeful that President Roosevelt
and the various NRA officials will eventually take cogni
zance of the unfair inequalities we suffer, and that they
will remedy them.",1

If the Negro workers in American industry are not
given the same protection that other laborers receive; if
we are denied the same wages and working hours pre
scribed for others who do similar work, it will be impossi
ble for the NRA to accomplish the lull measure of gen
eral recovery promised. The millions of Negro workers
in the United States must be guaranteed equal opportunity
with other citizens; else, Negro purchasing power will be
too limited to permit us to help restore prosperity, by
purchasing the products made by American industry.
As colored Americans, we are willing to do our part
in the present crisis. We are for the Government, the
